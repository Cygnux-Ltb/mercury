/**
 * A concurrent linked-list implementation of a {@link Deque} (double-ended queue). Concurrent insertion, removal, and access operations execute safely across multiple threads. Iterators are <i>weakly consistent</i>, returning elements reflecting the
 * state of the deque at some point at or since the creation of the iterator. They do <em>not</em> throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}, and may proceed concurrently with other operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class and its iterators implement all of the <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link Iterator} interfaces. Like most other concurrent collection implementations, this class does not permit the use of <tt>null</tt>
 * elements. because some null arguments and return values cannot be reliably distinguished from the absence of elements. Arbitrarily, the {@link Collection#remove} method is mapped to <tt>removeFirstOccurrence</tt>, and {@link Collection#add} is
 * mapped to <tt>addLast</tt>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Beware that, unlike in most collections, the <tt>size</tt> method is <em>NOT</em> a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these dequeue, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is <tt>Serializable</tt>, but relies on default serialization mechanisms. Usually, it is a better idea for any serializable class using a <tt>ConcurrentLinkedDeque</tt> to instead serialize a snapshot of the elements obtained by method
 * <tt>toArray</tt>.

     * This is an adaptation of an algorithm described in Paul Martin's "A Practical Lock-Free Doubly-Linked List". Sun Labs Tech report. The basic idea is to primarily rely on next-pointers to ensure consistency. Prev-pointers are in part
     * optimistic, reconstructed using forward pointers as needed. The main forward list uses a variant of HM-list algorithm similar to the one used in ConcurrentSkipListMap class, but a little simpler. It is also basically similar to the approach in
     * Edya Ladan-Mozes and Nir Shavit "An Optimistic Approach to Lock-Free FIFO Queues" in DISC04.
     *
     * Quoting a summary in Paul Martin's tech report:
     *
     * All cleanups work to maintain these invariants: (1) forward pointers are the ground truth. (2) forward pointers to dead nodes can be improved by swinging them further forward around the dead node. (2.1) forward pointers are still correct when
     * pointing to dead nodes, and forward pointers from dead nodes are left as they were when the node was deleted. (2.2) multiple dead nodes may point forward to the same node. (3) backward pointers were correct when they were installed (3.1)
     * backward pointers are correct when pointing to any node which points forward to them, but since more than one forward pointer may point to them, the live one is best. (4) backward pointers that are out of date due to deletion point to a
     * deleted node, and need to point further back until they point to the live node that points to their source. (5) backward pointers that are out of date due to insertion point too far backwards, so shortening their scope (by searching forward)
     * fixes them. (6) backward pointers from a dead node cannot be "improved" since there may be no live node pointing forward to their origin. (However, it does no harm to try to improve them while racing with a deletion.)
