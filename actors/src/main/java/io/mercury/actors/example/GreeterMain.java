/**

 * @author <b>Akka official</b><br>
 *         <br>
 *         <doc> Each actor defines a type T for the messages it can receive.
 *         Case classes and case objects make excellent messages since they are
 *         immutable and have support for pattern matching, something we will
 *         take advantage of in the Actor when matching on the messages it has
 *         received.<br>
 *         <br>
 *         The Hello World Actors use three different messages: <br>
 *         <br>
 *         Greet: command sent to the Greeter actor to greet Greeted: reply from
 *         the Greeter actor to confirm the greeting has happened SayHello:
 *         command to the GreeterMain to start the greeting process <br>
 *         <br>
 *         When defining Actors and their messages, keep these recommendations
 *         in mind: <br>
 *         <br>
 *         Since messages are the Actor’s public API, it is a good practice to
 *         define messages with good names and rich semantic and domain specific
 *         meaning, even if they just wrap your data type. This will make it
 *         easier to use, understand and debug actor-based systems. <br>
 *         <br>
 *         Messages should be immutable, since they are shared between different
 *         threads. <br>
 *         <br>
 *         It is a good practice to put an actor’s associated messages as static
 *         classes in the AbstractBehaavior’s class. This makes it easier to
 *         understand what type of messages the actor expects and handles. <br>
 *         <br>
 *         It is a good practice obtain an actor’s initial behavior via a static
 *         factory method <br>
 *         <br>
 *         Lets see how the implementations for Greeter, GreeterBot and
 *         GreeterMain demonstrate these best practices. <doc>
