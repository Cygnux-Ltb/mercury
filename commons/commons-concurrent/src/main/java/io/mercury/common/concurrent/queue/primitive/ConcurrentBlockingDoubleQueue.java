/**
 * A low latency, lock free, primitive bounded blocking queue backed by an
 * double[]. This class mimics the interface of
 * {@linkplain java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue BlockingQueue}, however works
 * with primitive doubles rather than {@link Object}s, so is unable to actually
 * implement the BlockingQueue .
 * <p>
 * This class takes advantage of the Unsafe.putOrderedInt, which allows us to
 * create non-blocking code with guaranteed writes. These writes will not be
 * re-ordered by instruction reordering. Under the covers it uses the faster
 * store-store barrier, rather than the the slower store-load barrier, which is
 * used when doing a volatile write. One of the trade off with this improved
 * performance is we are limited to a single producer, single consumer. For
 * further information on this see, the blog post
 * <a href="http://robsjava.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/a-faster-volatile.html">A
 * Faster Volatile</a> by Rob Austin.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out). The <em>head</em> of
 * the queue is that element that has been on the queue the longest time. The
 * <em>tail</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the queue the
 * shortest time. New elements are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the
 * queue retrieval operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This is a classic &quot;bounded buffer&quot;, in which a fixed-capacityd
 * array holds elements inserted by producers and extracted by consumers. Once
 * created, the capacity cannot be changed. Attempts to {@link #put put(e)} an
 * element into a full queue will result in the operation blocking; attempts to
 * {@link #take take()} an element from an empty queue will similarly block.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Due to the lock free nature of its implementation, ordering works on a first
 * come first served basis.
 * <p>
 * Methods come in four forms, with different ways of handling operations that
 * cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be satisfied at some point in the
 * future: one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either
 * <tt>null</tt> or <tt>false</tt>, depending on the operation), the third
 * blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed, and
 * the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving up. These
 * methods are summarized in the following table: <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3
 * CELLSPACING=1>
 * <tr>
 * <td></td>
 * <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Throws exception</em></td>
 * <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Special value</em></td>
 * <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Blocks</em></td>
 * <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Times out</em></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><b>Insert</b></td>
 * <td>{@link #add add(e)}</td>
 * <td>{@link #offer offer(e)}</td>
 * <td>{@link #put put(e)}</td>
 * <td>{@link #offer(double, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) offer(e, time,
 * unit)}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><b>Remove</b></td>
 * <td>{@link #poll poll()}</td>
 * <td>not applicable</td>
 * <td>{@link #take long()}</td>
 * <td>{@link #poll(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) poll(time, unit)}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><b>Examine</b></td>
 * <td><em>not applicable</em></td>

 * <p>
 * A <tt>uk.co.boundedbuffer.ConcurrentBlockingDoubleQueue</tt> is capacity
 * bounded. At any given time it may have a <tt>remainingCapacity</tt> beyond
 * which no additional elements can be <tt>put</tt> without blocking.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * It is not possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using
 * <tt>remove(x)</tt>. As this operation would not performed very efficiently.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * All of <tt>uk.co.boundedbuffer.ConcurrentBlockingDoubleQueue</tt> methods are
 * thread-safe when used with a single producer and single consumer, internal
 * atomicity is achieved using lock free strategies, such as sping locks.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Like a <tt>BlockingQueue</tt>, the
 * uk.co.boundedbuffer.ConcurrentBlockingDoubleQueue does <em>not</em>
 * intrinsically support any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot;
 * operation to indicate that no more items will be added. The needs and usage
 * of such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a common
 * tactic is for producers to insert special <em>end-of-stream</em> or
 * <em>poison</em> objects, that are interpreted accordingly when taken by
 * consumers.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario. Note that a
 * <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> can ONLY be used with a single producers and single
 * consumer thead.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *
 * Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().execute(new Runnable() {
 *
 * 	public void run() {
 * 		queue.put(1);
 * 	}
 * });
 *
 * Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().execute(new Runnable() {
 *
 * 	public void run() {
 * 		final int value = queue.take();
 * 	}
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in
 * a thread prior to placing an object into a {@code BlockingQueue}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the
 * {@code BlockingQueue} in another thread.
