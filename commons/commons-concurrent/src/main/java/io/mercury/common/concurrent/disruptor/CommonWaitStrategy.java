	 * the loop. On a typical Linux system this will pause the thread for around
	 * 60Âµs. <br>
	 * <br>
	 * This has the benefits that the producing thread does not need to take any
	 * action other increment the appropriate counter and that it does not require
	 * the cost of signalling a condition variable. However, the mean latency of
	 * moving the event between the producer and consumer threads will be higher.
	 * <br>
	 * <br>
	 * It works best in situations where low latency is not required, but a low
	 * impact on the producing thread is desired. A common use case is for
	 * asynchronous logging.

	 * The YieldingWaitStrategy will busy spin, waiting for the sequence to
	 * increment to the appropriate value. Inside the body of the loop
	 * Thread#yield() will be called allowing other queued threads to run. <br>
	 * <br>
	 * This is the recommended wait strategy when you need very high performance,

	 * logical cores, e.g. you have hyper-threading enabled.
