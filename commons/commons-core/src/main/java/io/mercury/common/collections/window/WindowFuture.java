/**
 * A {@link WindowFuture} is either <em>uncompleted</em> or <em>completed</em>.
 * When an operation begins, a new future object is created. The new future is
 * uncompleted initially - it is neither succeeded, failed, nor cancelled
 * because the operation is not finished yet. If the operation is finished
 * either successfully, with failure, or by cancellation, the future is marked
 * as completed with more specific information, such as the cause of the
 * failure. Please note that even failure and cancellation belong to the
 * completed state.
