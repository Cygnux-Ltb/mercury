/**
 * Smarter WeakReference that "unwraps" the referenced object in a few methods
 * such as "equals()" which let a WeakReference be used in many other types of
 * collections and lists and have them still work correctly. For exmaple,
 * CopyOnWriteArrayList can be directly used with a UnwrappedWeakReference and
 * have methods like "addIfAbsent" actually work correctly.
